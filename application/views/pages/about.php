								that strives to bring you the best customized, and functional websites. I achieved 
								an associate degree in Computer Programming from Austin Community College and fell in 
								love with web development and design. Along the way, I noticed my family and friends were
								becoming small business owners. Thatâ€™s why I started Designs By Nette. Small business owners deserve 
								attractive websites exactly like huge businesses. With that in mind, I do not believe in overcharging you for 
								the work I provide. After discussing your needs, I will provide you with a customized quote depending on your 
								business's strategy. I understand budget constraints and will work with your business to deliver a final project
								that meets your budget.
